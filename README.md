# cancer_immunology
This repo contains material from the Mathematical Modelling class I am teaching in Spelman College, Math Department.
The class focuses on fundemantal mathematical oncology concepts. In particlar, we study **mathematical modelling in tumor immunology**, 
including newly emerging CART-cell therapies. 

I have not put my lecture notes together, I hope it will arive soon. The repo mostly contains 
Matlab implementation of several problems. I did my best to provide useful comments whenever possible in these codes. 
Organization of the folders are as follows;
1- cartMath: we tried to replicate most of the results from "[A Mathematical Model of CAR-T Immunotherapy
2- lectures: matlab implementations of some of the topics we discussed, such as solving ODEs in matlab, parameter fitting etc.
in **[Preclinical Studies of Hematological Cancers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34208323/)** by Barros et.al. Every matlab file refers to the corresponding
figure in the paper. Carefully read the comments at the beginning of each code.
3- assignments: assignment and suggested solution. We actually do not that much(:
4- paper: these are the papers we used throughout the semester. The ones numbered [1-5] will be presented by the groups in the class.
5- presentations: we will post our presentations in this folder, hand on, coming soon...
