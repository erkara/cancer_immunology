# cancer_immunology
This repository contains materials from my Mathematical Modelling course at Spelman College's Math Department. The class focuses on fundamental concepts in mathematical oncology, 
with a specific emphasis on mathematical modelling in tumor immunology, including the latest developments in CART-cell therapies

My lecture notes have not been organized yet. The repository currently contains Matlab implementations of various problems, and I have included helpful 
comments in the code where I could. The folders are organized as follows:

1.  *cartMath*: we tried to replicate most of the results from **[A Mathematical Model of CAR-T Immunotherapyin Preclinical Studies of Hematological Cancers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34208323/)** by Barros et.al. Every matlab file refers to the corresponding figure in the paper. Carefully read the comments at the beginning of each code.

2.  *lectures*: matlab implementations of some of the topics we discussed, such as solving ODEs in matlab, parameter fitting etc.

3.  *assignments*: assignment and suggested solution. We actually do not have that much(:

4.  *papers*: these are the papers we used throughout the semester. The ones numbered [1-5] will be presented by the groups in the class.

5.  *presentations*: You can find our group presentations in this folder. We have summarized the key findings from the papers we studied and replicated some of the results. If you would like to learn more about the presentations or connect with the team members, please feel free to reach out to us via email using the following list.
